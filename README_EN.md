- [Python and libraries versions](#python-and-libraries-versions)

### Requirements for labs

1. Send jupyter notebooks with the following file name: `<Group number>_<Surname><Initials>_lab_<lab number>_<lab name>.ipynb`, e.g., `0000_PetrovMV_lab_1_pandas.ipynb`
   
   Print out the name of the lab and the full name of the author in the title of the notebook (in the very first cell).

2. All cells that require calculation must be calculated, and the output of the cells must be displayed in the sent notebook.
   > An empty notebook with cleared cells output is not accepted.

3. Inside the jupyter notebook, in markdown cells, it is mandatory to duplicate the task condition in the form of a table of contents, and arrange each subtask with a markdown cell with a description of the subtask.

4. It is advisable to comment on the code blocks that realised a particular function.

5. If possible, structure the code into small logical blocks, each in its own cell, so that it is easy to understand.

6. If a dataset is used in the work, then you must provide a link to it and a description of the dataset. 
It is advisable to provide a brief description of the dataset.

### Miscellaneous

#### The problem with displaying JavaScript based plots

[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) can help with some JS based plots visualization. For example, plots using `Plotly` in lecture 2 and some of JS plots in lecture 6 are displayed correctly in `nbviewer`, except plots generated by `CatBoost` (although `CatBoost` uses `Plotly` for plot generation and displaying).  
It is necessary to sign the notebook according to [Trusting Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html#trusting-notebooks) for JS code and some HTML code blocks are to be rendered correctly:
```bash
jupyter trust lecture_6.ipynb
```
A message should appear:
```bash
Signing notebook: .\lecture_6.ipynb
```
